A simple Pomodoro Timer for you to use at work!

# The Pomodoro Technique
The Pomodoro Technique is a way of increasing your productivity.
It goes like this:

1. Work for 25 minutes
2. Take a break for 5 minutes
3. Each session in which you work for 25 minutes and take a break for 5 minutes is called a Pomodoro.
4. After 4 - 5 Pomodoros, take a break for 20 - 30 minutes
5. Repeat

Doing this on your own though takes a lot of work, setting timers and remembering how many Pomodoros you have gone through so far.
This timer solves that problem. There is a Pomodoro Count which lets you keep track of your Pomodoros and it basically does all the work for you!
